# *Node-Face Blog*
This application uses  HTML integrated with AngularJS as a front-end, and allows users to create an account through the application and post blog entries including photos which are then posted on a homepage for all users to see. Persistent storage is implemented using MongoDB, routing was handled using Express and the Front-End was created using Angular Material provided by the AngularJS Framework.

## *To Run:*
Clone or download the repo and move into the project directory and execute ```npm install``` to install all dependencies for the project. Execute ```npm run start:server``` to run the service associated with the application. To run the front-end execute ```ng serve``` . The application service runs on ```localhost:3000```. The front-end runs on ```localhost:4200```.

## *What I Learned:*

* Creating an AngularJS front-end using Angular Material
* Using routes with Express.js
* Using BCrypt to hash passwords.
* Creating tokens with jsonwebtoken
* Implementing a MongoDB database using Mongoose

_**Please ignore excessive comments within this Project. I use them as a way to learn when implementing a new project, as I find it improves my retention of programming language concepts and language syntax when they are used .**_ üññüèª
